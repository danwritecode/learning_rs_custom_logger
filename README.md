# Custom Log Provider

Goal of this project is to learn how to implement my own logger than can be used as a provider for the Log crate. 

The secondary goal was to figure out how to use dependency injection with a "LogProvider" trait that I can implement on N number of concrete LogProviders (db logger, axiom, datadog, etc).


#### Concerns
Shit's super sloppy
